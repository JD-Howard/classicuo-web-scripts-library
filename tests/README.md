# Unit Tests
This folder contains unit tests for the non-UOC specific code used in the shared `_library.ts` files. It is possible to create mocks for the UOC native types and unit test "scripts" code, but are not expected.

**NOTE:** Any new files need to have the `*.test.ts` file extension to be recognized by the VSCode launch configuration.
