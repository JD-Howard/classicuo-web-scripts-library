# CLASSIC UO TYPE DEFINITIONS

All of the type definitions in this folder were at least initially derived from the official documentation on 08/30/2025 using DeepSeek. They have since been cleaned up a little bit and verified it wasn't entirely missing a function or property. About 60% of the functions and properties were test in UOC web client editor. Many of the return types were inspected and mapped to object types that weren't necessarily in the documentation. However, none of this has been fully audited for correctness, the examples were rarely tested, the input/return types may or may not have been checked/generated/defined or may in fact have alternate compatible types, and the types I introduced not explicitly documented per Classic UO Editor investigations are subjective and should not be directly referenced in your script code.
